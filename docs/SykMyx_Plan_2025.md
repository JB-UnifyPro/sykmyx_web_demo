Executive summary
This document describes the path from the current static/demo site to a production-grade SykMyx platform focused on aggregating 30s previews. It includes technical migration steps (component-based UI and centralized audio), a full monetization strategy (freemium tiers, labels, promoted placements, ads), the indie pilot as part of the financial plan, updated expenses, breakeven math, and actionable 0–90 day and 12‑month targets.

Primary goals:
- Migrate to a component-based UI (React/Next.js recommended).
- Implement a single AudioManager + AudioPlayer components and proper lifecycle/cleanup.
- Launch an indie labels & artists pilot and convert it to recurring revenue.
- Use freemium + promoted slots + targeted ads as the primary revenue mix to reach profitability quickly while keeping costs low.

Current state (summary)
- Working demo (home.html) with search and 30s Apple preview playback; runtime errors fixed.
- Deployed to Vercel.
- Architecture is single-file/global functions; migration to components pending.
- Pilot materials partially drafted; outreach plan defined.

Completed:
- Console error fixes, verified deploys.

Outstanding:
- Migrate to React/Next and AudioManager.
- Implement artist onboarding, billing, promotions UI, and minimal ad inventory.
- Instrument analytics and billing.

Product & business path
Phases:
1. Outreach Prep (2–4 weeks)
   - Finalize pricing, tiers, media kit, demo video, and legal pilot documents.
   - Build contact list: 600–1,000 indie artists + 150 labels for pilot outreach.
2. Indie Pilot (8–12 weeks)
   - Onboard 30–150 pilot artists/10–30 labels with a special pilot offer.
   - Sell initial promoted slots and gather metrics (trial→paid, CAC, churn).
3. Migrate frontend & core features (4–8 weeks)
   - Scaffold Next.js + AudioManager + AudioPlayer components.
   - Migrate search/results and onboarding.
4. Productize & scale (ongoing)
   - Dashboard, analytics, admin UI, ad inventory, and billing flows.
   - Add ad-serving & reporting for promoted placements and programmatic fill.

Freemium pricing tiers (recommended)
Goal: attract artists with a compelling free tier while driving upgrades via feature/track caps and promoted placements.

Free (Forever)
- Price: $0
- Limits: Up to 5 tracks; basic artwork & metadata; last-30-day play counts; email community support.
- Soft play cap: 100 plays/month before “upgrade” prompt.

Starter
- Price: $5 / month or $45 / year
- Limits: Up to 25 tracks; weekly analytics; one CSV export/month; priority email support.

Pro (Primary revenue)
- Price: $9 / month or $90 / year
- Limits: Up to 150 tracks; full analytics (geo, referrers); CSV exports; promotions queue access; priority onboarding.

Label / Team
- Price: $39 – $99 / month (tiered by seats / track volume)
- Perks: multi-user, bulk upload, label-level analytics, discounted promoted slots.

Add-ons
- Promoted placement slot: $75–$200 / slot / month (suggest $100 baseline).
- Premium one-off analytics report: $15–$49.
- Annual billing discount (10–20%) to improve retention & cashflow.

Why track/feature caps (instead of play caps)
Previews have low bandwidth costs; limiting metadata/tracks and analytics reduces support burden while leaving discovery usable for everyone.

Ads & promoted placements strategy
Primary ad revenue sources:
1. Promoted placement / featured slots (direct sales) — top priority.
   - Limited inventory, monthly subscription per slot, high margin.
2. Label sponsorships / branded sections.
3. Native in-feed promotions (promoted result cards).
4. Affiliate/referral revenue (DSP clicks) as incremental income.
5. Programmatic display (AdSense / GAM) as filler inventory once traffic grows.

Implementation specifics:
- Build admin UI to mark and schedule promoted slots.
- Tag promoted items in UI (clear “Promoted” label).
- Instrument impressions, clicks and conversions; provide monthly reports to advertisers.
- Remove or hide ads for paid Pro/Label users (ad-free benefit).
- Be cautious with audio ads—avoid pre-rolls for 30s previews unless partner-deal and opt-in UX.

Expected CPM/CPC (illustrative):
- Programmatic display CPM: $0.5 – $5
- Native/promoted effective CPM: $5 – $25
- Promoted slot avg price: $75 – $200 / month

Quick revenue example (conservative)
- 6 promoted slots × $100 = $600/mo
- Affiliate/referral / clicks = $200/mo
- Programmatic display (small) = $100/mo
- Total ad & promoted revenue (initial) ≈ $900/mo — meaningful toward breakeven.

Technical migration plan (summary)
Stack
- React + Next.js, JS → TypeScript later, Tailwind optional.
- Single AudioManager (singleton) + AudioPlayer components.
- Small global store (Zustand or Context) for playback state.

Phases & deliverables
- Scaffold & AudioManager (2–3 weeks)
- Migrate search/results & onboarding (3–6 weeks)
- Artist/Label dashboard & promoted slot admin (4–8 weeks)
- Hardening, CI, tests, PWA features (2–4 weeks)

Acceptance criteria
- One Audio element active at any time; Media Session integration; no runtime console errors; billing & promotion admin functional.

Updated costs — consolidated and adjusted
Assumptions:
- Lean ops target remains $1,200 / month baseline, but ad & promoted revenue reduces net fixed burden.
- Use Philippines contractors for dev/support to keep upfront and monthly burn low.

One-time (upfront)
- Lean dev (MVP + onboarding + billing + promoted UI): $4,000 – $8,000 (PH)
- Marketing collateral + media kit + demo video: $500 – $2,000
- Legal & accounting initial: $600 – $2,500
- Contingency (10%): $500 – $1,000  
Estimated lean upfront total: $5,600 – $13,500

Monthly recurring (lean baseline)
- Hosting / CDN / image CDN: $10 – $100
- DB & backup: $0 – $50
- Email/CRM & outreach tools: $10 – $200
- PH support/dev retainer: $400 – $1,200
- Monitoring & misc: $50 – $200
- Marketing/outreach & small paid tests: $100 – $1,000  
Estimated lean monthly: $570 – $2,000 (use $1,200 target for breakeven math)

Added costs if scaling or buying traffic:
- Paid marketing: $1,000–$5,000/mo
- ACR / fingerprinting (optional): $20–$500/mo
- Dedicated senior engineer/PM (US): $6k–$15k/mo (if hiring in US)

Updated revenue assumptions & unit economics
Prices used:
- Free: $0
- Starter: $5/mo
- Pro: $9/mo (Artist Pro)
- Label Starter: $39/mo
- Promoted slot: $100/mo (contribution ≈ $95 after fees)
- Programmatic/affiliate baseline: variable; small initially

Contributions (conservative)
- Artist contribution ≈ $8.10 / month (after payment fees & minor variable costs)
- Label contribution ≈ $35 / month
- Promoted slot contribution ≈ $95 / month

Key KPI assumptions (baseline)
- Churn: 5% / month (avg lifetime ~20 months)
- CAC (outreach/manual): $10–$30 per artist
- Conversion (free → paid): 5–15% depending on messaging & trial
- Payback target: < 6 months on CAC

Revised breakeven & profit scenarios (indie-only emphasis)
Baseline fixed monthly cost = $1,200 (ops + minimal marketing + support)

1. Artists-only
- Break-even artists = 1,200 / 8.10 ≈ 148 paying artists

2. Label mix (90% artists, 10% labels)
- Blended contribution ≈ (0.9×8.1 + 0.1×35) ≈ 10 → break-even ≈ 120 accounts

3. Add promoted slots (example: 6 slots)
- Promoted slot contribution: 6 × 95 = $570
- Remaining fixed = 1,200 − 570 = $630 → artists required = 630 / 8.1 ≈ 78

4. Add promoted + programmatic baseline (example +$300 / month)
- Combined non-subscription revenue = 570 + 300 = 870
- Remaining fixed = 1,200 − 870 = 330 → artists required = 330 / 8.1 ≈ 41

Practical: selling a handful of promoted slots and a small programmatic baseline reduces required artist count dramatically and makes indie-only profitability fast and attainable.

Freemium conversion & traffic model (example)
Start metrics to aim for (months 0–12)
- Target outreach list: 1,000 contacts
- Reach & trial interest: 15–25% → 150–250 trials
- Free→Paid conversion (trial): 20–40% (if trial is strong)
- Natural free-to-paid conversion (self-serve): 3–8% monthly
- Net paid artists by month 6 (gradual): aim 80–200 depending on conversion & outreach cadence

Example path to ~150 paying artists:
- Seed 600 targeted outreach contacts
- Trial uptake 20% → 120 trials
- Convert 40% of trials → 48 paid initial
- Ongoing outreach & referral can add +10–25 net paid artists per month to reach 150 in 6–12 months

Ads & promoted revenue incorporated into projections
Short-term strategy:
- Pre-sell 3–6 promoted slots to labels/curators during pilot (intro pricing).
- Add a low-friction programmatic banner (AdSense) as filler revenue.
- Offer newsletter sponsorship once audience grows.

Example incremental revenue (initial)
- 4 promoted slots × $100 = $400/mo
- Affiliate/referral clicks & small programmatic = $150/mo
- Ads + promoted = $550/mo → reduces required artists by ~68 (550 / 8.1 ≈ 68)

Result: combining subscription revenue with promoted/ad revenue substantially lowers the number of paying artists needed to be profitable.

0–90 day action plan (updated to include ads & tiers)
Days 0–7
- Confirm final tier prices & limits (I recommend Free / Starter $5 / Pro $9 / Label $39).
- Create media kit and promoted slot specs.

Days 7–30
- Implement minimal onboarding, Stripe billing, and promoted slot admin UI (lean dev).
- Launch pilot landing page & demo assets; begin outreach.

Days 30–90
- Run outreach to 600–1,000 targets, onboard pilots.
- Pre-sell promoted slots (aim 3–6).
- Add basic programmatic ad unit (AdSense) and instrument metrics.
- Monitor KPIs weekly (trials, CAC, conversion, churn, promoted sales).

12-month target (lean strategy)
- Upfront dev + launch costs: $6k (lean PH dev + legal + media)
- Monthly ops target: $1,200

Revenue targets:
- 150 paying Artists × $9 = $1,350/mo
- 4 promoted slots × $100 = $400/mo
- Ads & affiliate = $150/mo
- Combined = $1,900/mo → good operating margin above baseline ops

Timeline:
- Break-even on ops when combined revenue ≥ $1,200/mo (target by month 6–12)
- Recoup dev spend by month 9–18 depending on conversion and promoted slot sales

Risks & mitigations (updated)
- Low promoted sales: pre-sell slots to pilot labels and reserve inventory; demonstrate early performance metrics.
- Ad UX complaints: keep ads unobtrusive; ad-free for paid users.
- High CAC or low conversion: prioritize manual outreach, partnerships, PR, and pilot case studies.
- Platform TOS/legal: confirm official preview endpoints and legal review. Use artist-provided preview links if needed.

KPIs to instrument (priority)
- MRR, New MRR, Churn, LTV, CAC
- Active previews/day, Play → Click conversion to DSPs
- Trials started → paid, Free→Paid conversion rate
- Promoted slot sales & utilization
- Ad impressions, CTR, CPM, revenue per ad unit
- Support load and onboarding completion rate

Next steps (practical)
1. Confirm final tier limits & pricing (I recommend Free / $5 Starter / $9 Pro / $39 Label / $100 promoted slot).
2. Approve lean dev budget and let me scaffold the Next.js + AudioManager starter files.
3. Start outreach list building and pre-sell promoted slots to labels.
4. Instrument analytics and ad impressions, then iterate on pricing and inventory.
